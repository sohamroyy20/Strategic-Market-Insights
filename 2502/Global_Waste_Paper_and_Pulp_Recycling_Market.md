 <p>Waste paper and pulp recycling refers to the process of recovering and reprocessing used paper and paper products to create new paper or other products. This involves collecting discarded paper (such as newspapers, office paper, magazines, and packaging), breaking it down into its fibrous components (pulp), and removing contaminants like ink, adhesives, and coatings. The recycled pulp can then be used to produce new paper or cardboard products, reducing the need for virgin wood fibers, saving energy, conserving natural resources, and decreasing landfill waste. Recycling paper also helps lower greenhouse gas emissions associated with paper production.</p>
