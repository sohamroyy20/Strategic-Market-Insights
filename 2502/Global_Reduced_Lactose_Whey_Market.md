 <p>Reduced lactose whey is the whey powder that contains less lactose concentration, i.e., less than 60%. The reduced lactose whey is manufactured by filtering the lactose from the sweet whey liquid. The lactose is removed by either precipitation, filtration or dialysis. The filtered liquid is then spray dried to produce a powder known as reduced lactose whey. It is mostly a substitute for whey when low lactose and higher protein content is required.</p>
