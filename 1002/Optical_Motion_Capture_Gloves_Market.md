 <p>Optical motion capture gloves place infrared reflective balls on the joints, and use multiple external infrared cameras to shoot and capture the movements of the hands. It is because the hand movement is easily blocked or the infrared positioning point of the hand is small and easy to lose, so the resolution of the external motion capture camera is required to be higher.</p>
