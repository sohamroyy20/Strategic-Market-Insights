 <p>Oral hygiene is the practice of keeping one&#39;s mouth clean and free of disease and other problems by regular brushing and cleaning between the teeth. It is important that oral hygiene be carried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease. The most common types of dental disease are tooth decay and gum diseases, including gingivitis, and periodontitis. Regular brushing consists of brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before going to bed. Cleaning between the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth brushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and therefore only cleans 50% of the surfaces. There are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss, flossettes, and interdental brushes. It is up to each individual to choose which tool he or she prefers to use.</p>
