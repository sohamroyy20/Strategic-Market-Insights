 <p>The Brazilian Anti Fatigue Insoles market is growing, driven by increasing awareness of foot health and the needs of a large workforce in service and manufacturing sectors. Brazil&#39;s orthopedic products market, valued at over $1.2 billion in 2023, supports the growth of specialized foot care products. Key trends include the use of advanced materials like memory foam and gel, customizable insoles, and eco-friendly options.
