 <p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Pico projector systems constitute an evolving technology and are expected to transform the global projector market, by shrinking the size of projectors, down to convenient sizes that fit into a hand. Pico projectors are very much light in mass and small in size as compared with the traditional business projectors. Thus, it can be easily carried by the user. For instance, pre-sales or sales person can carry Pico projector with the ease and can give on-spot presentation or demonstration. Such advantages of Pico projectors fuel the growth of the market. Media-player projectors include on-board memory (or a memory-card slot) and can play files directly from the memory (usually photos, videos and sometimes office documents too). In this report, we define the Pico projectors length less than 16cm.</p>
