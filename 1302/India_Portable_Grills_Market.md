 <p>The Indian Bed Guards market is showing steady growth, driven by increasing awareness of child safety and the growing elderly population. <strong>Key players</strong> include domestic manufacturers like Goodbaby Childcare and international brands such as Regalo and Dreambaby. The market benefits from India&#39;s large youth population and the cultural emphasis on multi-generational households. In 2024, 800,000 bed guards were sold in India, with a significant portion in the child safety segment. The industry is seeing a trend towards adjustable and portable bed guards that can accommodate different bed sizes. There&#39;s growing demand for aesthetically pleasing designs that blend with home decor. Manufacturers are focusing on developing bed guards with additional features like soft padding and easy-to-use locking mechanisms.

As India&#39;s urban population grows and safety consciousness increases, the Bed Guards market is expected to see continued growth, particularly in middle and upper-income households.
